## Code example:
**DESCRIPTION:**  
*Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.*  
*For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".*   
*Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.*

```
function disemvowel(str) {
  return str.replace(/[aeiou]/gi, ''); 
}
```

        <h4>DESCRIPTION:</h4>
        <p>Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.
            For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".
            Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.</p>
            <h4>SOLUTION:</h4>
        <pre>
            <code>
                function disemvowel(str) {
                    return str.replace(/[aeiou]/gi, ''); 
                  }
            </code>
